                <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,<br>
                     is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each,<br>
                      who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.<br>
                       The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving <br>
                        the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team.<br>
                         Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes.<br>
                     With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries </p>

                      (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop<br>
                       (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) <br>
                       high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the<br>
                        opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is<br>
                         worth two points, unless made from 
                    behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.</p>
